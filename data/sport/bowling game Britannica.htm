Each biome and habitat comes with its own selection of flora and fauna, and it may include physical features such as canyons, volcanoes, rivers, or caves. Human beings have built homes in many different environments, settling the area and organizing it into units such as cities, states, regions, and countries, each with its own points of interest.

The fight for human and civil rights has persisted for hundreds of years and remains alive today, both within the borders of nations and on an international scale.

The earliest Greek philosophers focused their attention upon the origin and nature of the physical world; later philosophers have theorized about the nature of knowledge, truth, good and evil, love, friendship, and much more. Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},{"id":9000,"title":"Politics, Law & Government","urlTitle":"Politics-Law-Government","description":"The world today is divided territorially into more than 190 countries, each of which possesses a national government that claims to exercise sovereignty and seeks to compel obedience to its will by its citizens. Governments can be classified in any number of ways. For example, they might be classified by the number of rulers, thus distinguishing government by one (as in a monarchy or a tyranny) from government by the few (in an aristocracy or oligarchy) and from government by the many (as in a democracy). Governments can also be classified by mode of succession; for example, ascension to governmental leadership may follow the rules of hereditary succession, or it may be determined through elections or by force. Governments also vary in terms of the laws and rules of conduct that each political entity follows.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg","altText":"Politics, Law & Government","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg"}},{"id":1000,"title":"Science","urlTitle":"Science","description":"How can the sky be blue one day and stormy the next?

Human beings have long been curious about the world in which we live, striving to identify connections among the phenomenons we witness and to understand how it all works. The field of science has developed over many centuries as a way of studying and understanding the world, beginning with the primitive stage of simply noting important regularities in nature and continuing through the rise of modern science.

<section id="ref29796" data-level="2"><h2 class="h2">Origin and early period</h2>
<p class="topic-paragraph">Articles found in the tomb of an Egyptian child buried in about 3200 <span class="text-smallcaps">bc</span> included nine pieces of stone, to be set up as pins, at which a stone “ball” was rolled, the ball having first to roll through an archway made of three pieces of marble. The modern sport of bowling at pins probably originated in ancient <span id="ref403537"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Germany" class="md-crosslink">Germany</a>, not as a sport but as a religious ceremony. As early as the 3rd or 4th century <span class="text-smallcaps">ad</span>, in rites held in the cloisters of churches, parishioners may have placed their ever-present club, or <em>Kegel</em> (the <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="implement" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/implement" data-type="MW">implement</a> most Germans carried for sport and, certainly, self-protection), at one end of a runway resembling a modern bowling lane. The <em>Kegel</em> was said to represent the <em>Heide</em> (“heathen”). A stone was rolled at the <em>Heide</em>, and those successfully toppling it were believed to have cleansed themselves of sin. Although the peasants’ club evolved into pins, the association remained, and even today bowlers are often called keglers.</p><!--[P3]--><span class="marker p3"></span><!--[AM3]--><span class="marker AM3 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD3]--><span class="marker MOD3 mod-inline"></span>
<p class="topic-paragraph">The passage of time brought an increase in the size of the stone rolled at pins, and eventually the ball came to be made of wood. Many variations of the game developed, some played with three pins, others with as many as 17. A biographer of the 16th-century cleric <span id="ref403538"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Martin-Luther" class="md-crosslink">Martin Luther</a> has written that Luther built a bowling lane for his children which he occasionally visited, sometimes throwing the first ball.</p><!--[P4]--><span class="marker p4"></span><!--[AM4]--><span class="marker AM4 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD4]--><span class="marker MOD4 mod-inline"></span>
<p class="topic-paragraph">Among other significant historical references to bowling are an account of a great feast given the citizenry of Frankfurt in 1463, at which the venison dinner was followed by bowling; notations from 1325 in which “gambling on bowling” in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Berlin" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Berlin</a> and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Cologne-Germany" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Cologne</a> was limited to five shillings; and the award of an ox to the winner of a bowling competition in 1518, given by the city of Breslau (now Wrocław, Pol.).</p><!--[P5]--><span class="marker p5"></span><!--[AM5]--><span class="marker AM5 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD5]--><span class="marker MOD5 mod-inline"></span>
<p class="topic-paragraph">In the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries, the game spread into the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Low-Countries" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Low Countries</a> and also into Austria and Switzerland. The playing surfaces were usually cinders or clay, specially treated and sun-baked to a hardness <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="resembling" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/resembling" data-type="EB">resembling</a> concrete. The roofing over of lanes, first done in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/London" class="md-crosslink autoxref">London</a> for lawn bowls around 1455, was the beginning of bowling as an all-weather, around-the-clock game. When the lanes were covered or put into sheds (called <em>Kegelbahns</em> in Germany and Austria and usually attached to village taverns or guest houses), the playing surfaces ranged from wood or hardened clay to, in later years, asphalt.</p><!--[P6]--><span class="marker p6"></span><!--[AM6]--><span class="marker AM6 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD6]--><span class="marker MOD6 mod-inline"></span></section>
<section id="ref29797" data-level="2"><h2 class="h2">Bowls and pins in North America</h2>
<p class="topic-paragraph">There is confusion about how and when bowling at pins came to North <span id="ref403539"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/United-States" class="md-crosslink">America</a>, arising from the inconsistent use of the terms bowl, bowler, and bowling. The early British settlers brought lawn bowls with them to America because that was the game they knew best. Dutch explorers under <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henry-Hudson" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Henry Hudson</a> were said to have brought some form of pin bowling.</p><!--[P7]--><span class="marker p7"></span><!--[AM7]--><span class="marker AM7 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD7]--><span class="marker MOD7 mod-inline"></span>
<p class="topic-paragraph">Many of the early European pin games involved rolling the ball along a wooden plank, 12 to 18 inches (30 to 46 centimetres) wide and 60 to 90 feet (18 to 27 metres) long, toward a diamond-shaped formation of nine pins. The plank still can be found in parts of Europe, notably in eastern European countries, where bowling games called bohle, asphalt, and schere are popular. In these, the nine pins are smaller than tenpins, and the duckpin-type ball, without finger holes, is held in the palm of the hand. The Netherlands has a “plank” game in which a large ball, with only a thumbhole, is rolled on the plank toward the nine pins. The earliest known reference to bowling in the United States was made by <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Washington-Irving" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Washington Irving</a> in his <a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/short-story" class="md-crosslink autoxref">short story</a> “Rip Van Winkle” (1819–1820).</p><!--[P8]--><span class="marker p8"></span><!--[AM8]--><span class="marker AM8 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD8]--><span class="marker MOD8 mod-inline"></span>
<span id="ref29797" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref29798" data-level="3"><h2 class="h3">Emergence of the tenpin game</h2>
<p class="topic-paragraph">By the mid-1830s, as bowling at pins was <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="flourishing" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/flourishing" data-type="EB">flourishing</a>, the scourge that periodically struck the game in Germany, France, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/England" class="md-crosslink autoxref">England</a>, and other countries—gambling—became a plague on the U.S. bowling scene. To combat the problem, the state legislature of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Connecticut" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Connecticut</a> in 1841 banned the playing of “Nine-Pins, whether more or less than nine-pins are used.” However, a month before the Connecticut legislation, the town of Perry, N.Y., had enacted a law banning tenpins. There are other earlier signs of tenpin bowling, including a painting, traced to 1810, that shows English dandies playing a game with 10 oddly shaped pins set up outside a factory in Ipswich, Eng., an area that was populated by many Dutch immigrants in the 1700s. Regardless of how tenpins came into being, its popularity spread as German immigrants began populating Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Louis (Mo.), Cincinnati (Ohio), Detroit, and other cities. Although intercity bowling events were becoming common, the lack of uniform playing rules and equipment specifications <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="stifled" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/stifled" data-type="EB">stifled</a> the development of the game. In 1875 delegates from nine bowling clubs in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/New-York-City" class="md-crosslink autoxref">New York City</a> and Brooklyn, N.Y., organized the National Bowling Association. Some of the legislation agreed upon then is still in effect in modified form, but the group lacked national acceptance.</p><!--[P9]--><span class="marker p9"></span><!--[AM9]--><span class="marker AM9 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD9]--><span class="marker MOD9 mod-inline"></span></section>
<span id="ref29797" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref29799" data-level="3"><h2 class="h3">Organization and tournaments</h2>
<p class="topic-paragraph">Disagreement over rules continued, principally as an alignment of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/New-York-state" class="md-crosslink autoxref">New York</a> bowlers against everyone else. On Sept. 9, 1895, the <span id="ref403540"></span>American Bowling Congress (ABC) was organized in New York City. Rules and equipment standards were developed, and the game as it finally was organized remained basically unchanged as the sport grew steadily. An early technological development that helped the sport’s progress was the introduction of the hard rubber <span id="ref403541"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/sports/ball-sports" class="md-crosslink">ball</a> in 1904, its predecessor having been made of <span id="ref403542"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/plant/lignum-vitae" class="md-crosslink">lignum vitae</a>, a tropical wood that was durable but that often chipped or otherwise lost its shape. The next big advance was the introduction of the automatic pin-setting machine in the early 1950s. Later, balls made of polyester and urethane were developed and in some cases replaced the hard rubber ball.</p><!--[P10]--><span class="marker p10"></span><!--[AM10]--><span class="marker AM10 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD10]--><span class="marker MOD10 mod-inline"></span>
<p class="topic-paragraph">In 1901 the ABC started its national <a href="https://www.britannica.com/sports/tournament-medieval-military-games" class="md-crosslink autoxref">tournament</a>. The <span id="ref403543"></span>Women’s International Bowling Congress (WIBC) was organized in 1916 and conducted annual national championships from 1917. While the ABC and WIBC are <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="autonomous" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/autonomous" data-type="MW">autonomous</a> organizations, each billing itself as the “world’s largest” men’s or women’s <a href="https://www.britannica.com/sports/sports" class="md-crosslink autoxref">sports</a> organization, respectively, they share a number of functions, including equipment testing and research and the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/joint-skeleton" class="md-crosslink autoxref">joint</a> issuance of credentials to the mixed leagues that made up more than 70 percent of their late 1980s combined membership of approximately 7,000,000. A third membership organization, the <span id="ref403544"></span>Young American Bowling Alliance (YABA; established in 1982), administers to the league and tournament needs of young bowlers through college age.</p><!--[P11]--><span class="marker p11"></span><!--[AM11]--><span class="marker AM11 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD11]--><span class="marker MOD11 mod-inline"></span>
<p class="topic-paragraph">In the late 20th century it was estimated that more than 60,000,000 persons bowled at least once or twice a year in the United States. The <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="backbone" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/backbone" data-type="EB">backbone</a> of the sport continued to be its highly organized, competitive league structure. Most men’s and women’s leagues consist of eight to 12 teams, but some have 40 or more, depending on the number of lanes in the bowling centre. League play is conducted under rules laid down by the three major membership organizations, including the handling of prize funds by the adult leagues. The prize funds are developed from the contestants’ entry fees and are distributed to the various teams and individuals on a performance basis.</p><!--[P12]--><span class="marker p12"></span><!--[AM12]--><span class="marker AM12 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD12]--><span class="marker MOD12 mod-inline"></span></section>

<p class="topic-paragraph">The <span id="ref403545"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Professional-Bowlers-Association-of-America" class="md-crosslink">Professional Bowlers Association of America</a> (PBA) was organized in 1958. It quickly developed a star system and a tournament tour fashioned after that of professional <a href="https://www.britannica.com/sports/golf" class="md-crosslink autoxref">golf</a>. PBA members, helped by a booming television industry, were soon playing for more than $1 million in yearly prize money; this figure had grown to more than $7 million by the late 1980s, though by the early 21st century the tour’s total prize monies awarded had dropped to about $4 million. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Don-Carter" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Don Carter</a> became the leading winner in the 1950s, succeeded by <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Dick-Weber" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Dick Weber</a> in the 1960s and Earl Anthony into the 1980s. The Professional Women Bowlers Association (1959; since 1981 called the Ladies Pro Bowlers Tour [LPBT]) began modest tournament play in the early 1960s. A major influence in development of the game was the <span id="ref403546"></span>Bowling Proprietors’ Association of America, founded in 1932. In addition to its <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/trade-association" class="md-crosslink autoxref">trade association</a> functions, it is <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="affiliated" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/affiliated" data-type="MW">affiliated</a> with a number of tournaments, most notably the All-Star tournament, a match game event begun in 1941 that in 1971 became the U.S. Open and a part of the PBA tour. The <span id="ref403547"></span>National Bowling Council, founded in 1943 by manufacturers, proprietors, and membership groups, concerns itself with national promotional campaigns and other activities.</p><!--[P13]--><span class="marker p13"></span><!--[AM13]--><span class="marker AM13 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD13]--><span class="marker MOD13 mod-inline"></span></section></section>

<p class="topic-paragraph">The first tenpin lanes in Europe were installed in Sweden in 1909. Attempts to popularize tenpin bowling elsewhere in Europe were unsuccessful over the next several decades, but the game became popular in Great Britain during <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/World-War-II" class="md-crosslink autoxref">World War II</a>, when hundreds of lanes were installed on U.S. military bases.</p><!--[P14]--><span class="marker p14"></span><!--[AM14]--><span class="marker AM14 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD14]--><span class="marker MOD14 mod-inline"></span>
<p class="topic-paragraph">As league bowling in the United States peaked in the mid-1960s, equipment manufacturers began looking elsewhere for new markets.

<p class="topic-paragraph">Documents indicate that an international competition was held in Hannover, Ger., as early as 1891. An early bowling <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="proprietor" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/proprietor" data-type="EB">proprietor</a> and promoter in New York City was so taken with the idea of international play that he sponsored an event in Union Hill, N.J., in 1900, but the use of the word international was only thinly justified by the appearance of some teams from Canada. Competitions apparently limited to ninepins and other “small ball” games were held in the German cities of Solingen (1904), Dresden (1908), and Berlin (1914). Few other than German bowlers were entered.</p><!--[P17]--><span class="marker p17"></span><!--[AM17]--><span class="marker AM17 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD17]--><span class="marker MOD17 mod-inline"></span>
<p class="topic-paragraph">In 1923 a group of American bowlers toured <span id="ref403550"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Sweden" class="md-crosslink">Sweden</a> and were roundly defeated by their hosts. The outcome was the same in 1926, at which time teams from Denmark, Finland, Norway, the Netherlands, and Germany joined the Swedes and Americans in forming the <span id="ref403551"></span>International Bowling Association. In 1929 they held what came to be called the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Third-International" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Third International</a> tournament, again in Sweden, followed by a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Fourth-International" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Fourth International</a> held in New York City in 1934. Germany hosted the Fifth International in 1936, as a prelude to, but having no connection with, the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/sports/Olympic-Games" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Olympic Games</a> in Berlin. It was the last international meet of any <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="consequence" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/consequence" data-type="EB">consequence</a> until the <span id="ref403552"></span>Fédération Internationale des Quilleurs (FIQ) was formed in 1952 to coordinate international amateur competition.

<p class="topic-paragraph">The first world tournament of the FIQ was held in Helsinki in 1954, and from 1967 championships were played every four years. Competition is held in three zones—American, European, and Asian. The organization has four sections, the principal one being devoted to tenpins. The other three are the small-ball games, schere, bohle, and asphalt. FIQ competition is for nonprofessionals; and gold, silver, and bronze medals are awarded to champions and runners-up.
